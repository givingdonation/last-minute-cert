An IP address is a 32 bit number that identifies a host on a network. But this  binary string is often converted to 4 decimal numbers separated by dots. A router only knows what the address of the next router is, not the exact destination of the packets. The first 24 bits specify where the host is, the last 8 specify the host itself. A subnet mask is a 32 bit string that splits the ip address host address from the network address.
IP addresses are divided into classes, class A addresses have the first octet from 1 to 127 and has a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, class B addresses from 128 to 191 and a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, and class C addresses from 192 to 223
A routing table is a table that holds the best routes for packets to go through.

In computer architecture, a bus (shortened form of the Latin omnibus, and historically also called data highway or databus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.
In a computer system, a chipset is a set of electronic components in one or more integrated circuits known as a "Data Flow Management System" that manages the data flow between the processor, memory and peripherals.
PCIe xn - Peripheral component interconnect express (n data lanes) - a connector that connects to input and output devices
X is how many lanes the PCIe slot has
The Motherboard is the place chips connect to so they can communicate to other components of the computer. The CPU is the chip on a that connects to the motherboard that does the actual general data processing for the computer. The North bridge is a chip on a motherboard that connects the CPU to the rest of the computer (DRAM, PCIe, etc) through the FSB (front side bus), the south bridge is a different chip that connects many kinds of input and output to the north bridge.

Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model)

1. Physical layer - Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium -
The physical technology that is used to actually send the data like hardware and cables

2. Data link layer - Transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a
physical layer - The data that wraps around the packets/units of data to tell when a
packet starts and ends and similar things

3. Network layer - Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing,
routing and traffic control - The actual headers (beginnings) of packets which have the
information the directs where the data goes in a network and similar information

4. Transport layer - Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network,
including segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing - The data that manages
network traffic and the organization of units of data

A. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol - A protocol in the transport layer of the OSI
model, which gives reliable, organized communication between computers in a
network, it is used by the world wide web, email, file transfer, among other
internet applications because of this

B. UDP - User Datagram Protocol - A protocol that allows for the sending of data
without having to communicate beforehand or make some kind of connection or
communication channel, this makes it very simple but not reliable or organized

5. Session layer - Managing communication sessions, i.e., continuous exchange of
information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes -
The data and mechanisms that maintains responses and requests between computers

6. Presentation layer - Translation of data between a networking service and an
application; including character encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption -
The conversion of data from a form that can be transported, which may be compressed,
encoded, or encrypted into data that can be actively used by programs

7. Application layer - High-level protocols such as for resource sharing or remote file
access, e.g. HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) - The procedures that actually end up
managing the content that the human sees

IEEE 802.1x is the standard (defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association) that specifies how you authenticate devices that wish to join a LAN (local area network). It determines how you use EAP (extensible authentication protocol), which is a flexible way of authenticating connections. In the standard there is an authenticator which prevents access to the network, and an authentication server, which uses RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service), a protocol which manages what is authorized on a network (or diameter which is RADIUSâ€™s successor). The authentication server can respond with access rejection (it denies all access to the network), access challenge (the server asks for more credentials), and access accept (Where the device requesting access is allowed into the LAN with certain permissions).
IEEE 802.1x is implemented in all major operating systems, and is a central part of network security. Despite this there are vulnerabilities in this standard. It was shown in 2005 that a man in the middle attack (where someone goes between a communication and frauds both sides) was possible, because after authentication, someone unauthorized could physically insert themselves. There are some alternatives to IEEE 802.1x, such as PANA (Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access), but they are not used as widely.

The six steps to troubleshooting:
Identify the problem.
Question user and identify user changes to the computer.
Perform backups before making changes.
Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes.
Review system and application logs.
Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious and if necessary
conduct internal or external research based on symptoms).
Test the theory to determine cause:
Once theory is confirmed, determine next steps to resolve the problem.
If theory is not confirmed, re-establish new theory or escalate.
Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution.
Verify full system functionality, and if applicable, implement preventative
measures.
Document findings, actions, and outcomes.

The use of 802.1x on Linux depends on what distribution of Linux you are using. But, in general there are 2 main projects for 802.1x supplicants, Xsupplicant and wpa_supplicant, which are developed by Open1x and Jouni Malinen respectively. They both work on windows too and wpa_supplicant also supports BSD and OS X. On the Linux distribution Ubuntu, wpa_suplicant is already loaded.[1] 
On Linux 802.1x is mainly configured using networkManager, which is a program for configuring network interfaces. Mac OS has supported 802.1x out of the box since version 10.3. The settings for 802.1x on Mac OS are in settings then network. While iOS has had support since version 2.0.

The IP address is the 32 bit (binary digit) number that is related to networking, and it is
simply what identifies hosts on an internet network. A host on a network is any computer or
device that connects to a network, while a network is a group of computers that are connected
together to communicate data. An octet is a group of eight bits. Because an IP address is 32
bits long, it is also four octets long. Because humans struggle to read binary, the IP address is
converted to four decimal numbers separated by dots for humans to read.
The parts of the IP address which designate the host address and the network address
aren't fixed, so the information for which part of the IP address is what, is in the subnet mask.
This number may be something like 255.255.255.0. The number 255 is special in that it is the
eight bit unsigned integer limit, which means that it is represented in binary as 11111111. This
means that in binary 255.255.255.0 is 11111111111111111111111100000000. How the information
is read is that the ones represent parts of the IP address that are for the network address, and
The zeros are the parts that are the host address. So for the subnet mask 255.255.255.0, the
The first three octets are for the network address and the last one is for the host address. IP
addresses are split into classes. A class A subnet mask looks like 255.0.0.0, and the first octet
of a class A address is in a range from 1 to 127. A class B subnet mask looks like 255.255.0.0,
and the first octet is in a range from 128 to 191. A class C subnet mask looks like 
255.255.255.0 and the first octet is in a range from 192 to 223.


A system administrator is someone with access to a system of computers and operates and manages a network. . A subnet mask is a 32 bit number that separates the network and host addresses. The 1 bits on a subnet mask mean that the section of bits is in the network address. The 0 bits on a subnet mask means that the section of bits is in the host address. The subnet mask 255.255.255.0 in binary looks like 11111111111111111111111100000000. When you change a subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.0 to .192 it causes 4 new networks to be available, because 11111111111111111111111111000000 has 2 more bits as part of the network address, so 4x as many possible network addresses. A default gateway is what lets a device on one subnet access devices on other networks. If you have an incorrect subnet mask, then devices on the subnet can communicate with hosts outside the subnet, but not with each other. If you have an incorrect IP address, hosts on the same network wonâ€™t be able to communicate because they will think they are on different networks. If you have an incorrect default gateway, then a host will be able to communicate with hosts on its subnet, but not with hosts outside of it.

Comer, Prentice Hall, 1995.

Nslookup
name server lookup
Command-line tool for network administration; it queries DNS servers for the IP addresses and other information corresponding to domain names. 
This command is similar to the dig and host unix commands, and is available on many operating systems, such as unix-like OSes and windows.
Example: 
nslookup -type=ns google.com ##find name servers for domain
nslookup google.com ns1.google.com ##use a name server for a dns request
nslookup 1.1.1.1 ##reverse dns lookup for cloudflare
Netstat
network statistics
A command-line utility for displaying TCP connections, routing tables, network interfaces, and protocol statistics. Used for finding network problems and usage statistics/performance.
It is available on many systems, unix/unix-like and windows.
Example:
netstat -ab ##displays all tcp connections and tcp/udp ports listened on, while also displaying the executable involved in making the connection
netstat -an ##displays all tcp connections and tcp/udp ports listened on, but no attempt is made to determine names (shown numerically), so it's a faster command to run
netstat -ao 5 ##displays the process ID for all connections, every 5 seconds
Net user
maintains network users
Adds or modifies user accounts, or displays user account information; takes as parameters, username, password, domain, and options.
This command has many options, such as disabling users, or listing accounts if not provided with parameters. It is available on windows.
Example:
net user friend /add /passwordreq:no /homedir:c:\ ##add a user with no pass requirements, whos home directory is c
net user carlo student /add ##add a user with pass student
net user carlo NewPass /logonpasswordchg:yes ## change a users password and force them to change while logging in
